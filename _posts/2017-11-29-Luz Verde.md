LuzVerde is a technological project of social entrepreneurship.
Specific hardware and software to help visual impaired people cross the street at intersections with traffic lights.
Using open data provided by the Cities, the user position (GPS) and the traffic light status, we notify in real time visual impaired people if the traffic light where they are located is green or red.

During HackForGood 2017, we developed a prototype and during the next 8 months we developed a business plan to make the project possible. Think Big program drove us on our journey.
In September 2017, we were recognized with the second position in HackForGood Big Day 2017, which rewards the continuity of the social entrepreneurship projects.
